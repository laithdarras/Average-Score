# Average Scores Project

This project implements a set of MIPS assembly functions to perform operations on an array of scores. The main features include printing arrays, performing selection sort, and calculating the sum of the array elements. Additionally, the project calculates and prints the average of the scores.

## Overview

This project was built for me to understand fundamental concepts in MIPS assembly language, such as recursion, iteration, and basic array manipulations. The project includes:

- Printing an array of integers
- Sorting an array using selection sort
- Calculating the sum of array elements recursively
- Computing and printing the average score

To run the project, load the ASM files into a MIPS simulator such as SPIM or MARS, assemble, and execute the program. Contributions are welcome through issues or pull requests. The project is licensed under the MIT License.
